"""
Implement a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression and
then calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place.

Assume that the user’s input will be formatted as x y z, with one space between x and y and one space between y and z, wherein:

x is an integer
y is +, -, *, or /
z is an integer

For instance, if the user inputs 1 + 1, your program should output 2.0. Assume that, if y is /, then z will not be 0.

x, y, z = expression.split(" ")

    print(round(float(x) + float(z), 1))
elif y == "-":
    print(round(float(x) - float(z), 1))
elif y == "*":
    print(round(float(x) * float(z), 1))
elif y == "/" and z != 0:
    print(round(float(x) / float(z), 1))
